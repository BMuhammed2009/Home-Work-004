        <h2>A seed phrase is a set of twelve words that contains all the information about your wallet, including your funds. It's like a secret code used to access your entire wallet.
            <h2>  You must keep your seed phrase secret and safe. If someone gets your seed phrase, they'll gain control over your accounts.
